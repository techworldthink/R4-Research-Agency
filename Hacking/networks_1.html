        <h2>Computer Network</h2>
        <p>
            An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the
            purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums
            which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and
            include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges.
            <br><br>
            A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be computer, printer, or any
            other device capable of sending or receiving the data. The links connecting the nodes are known as
            communication channels.
            <br><bR>
            Computer Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires, optical fibres or optical
            links so that various devices can interact with each other through a network.
            The aim of the computer network is the sharing of resources among various devices.
            In the case of computer network technology, there are several types of networks that vary from simple to
            complex level.
            <br><bR>
            Computer Network uses distributed processing in which task is divided among several computers. Instead, a
            single computer handles an entire task, each separate computer handles a subset<br><bR>
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of Distributed processing</h2>
        <p>
            Security <br>
            Faster problem solving<br>
            Security through redundancy<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Components Of Computer Network</h2>
        <h3>NIC(National interface card)</h3>
        <p>
            A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component without which a computer cannot be connected over a
            network. It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the
            computer. It is also called network interface controller, network adapter or LAN adapter.
            <br><bR>
            NIC is a device that helps the computer to communicate with another device. The network interface card
            contains the hardware addresses, the data-link layer protocol use this address to identify the system on the
            network so that it transfers the data to the correct destination.
            <br><bR>
            NIC allows both wired and wireless communications.<br><bR>

            NIC allows communications between computers connected via local area network (LAN) as well as communications
            over large-scale network through Internet Protocol (IP).<br><bR>

            NIC is both a physical layer and a data link layer device, i.e. it provides the necessary hardware circuitry
            so that the physical layer processes and some data link layer processes can run on it.<br><bR>
            NIC cards are of two types − Internal & External
            <br><bR>
            Every computer on a network, both clients and servers, requires a network interface card (or NIC) in order
            to access the network. A NIC is usually a separate adapter card that slides into one of the server’s
            motherboard expansion slots. However, most newer computers have the NIC built into the motherboard, so a
            separate card isn’t needed
        </p>
        <h3>Internal Network Cards</h3>
        <p>
            In internal networks cards, motherboard has a slot for the network card where it can be inserted. It
            requires network cables to provide network access. Internal network cards are of two types. The first type
            uses Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) connection, while the second type uses Industry Standard
            Architecture (ISA).<br>PCI NICs fit into a PCI slot on a motherboard. ISA NICs fit into an ISA slot.<br>

        </p>
        <h4>ISA and PCI Compared</h4>
        <p>
            For many years, ISA and PCI were equivalents. Because PCI was introduced as a complement to, rather than a
            direct competitor to ISA, it is not uncommon for motherboards to have both ISA and PCI ports. ISA, at least
            for a time, was concurrent with the PCI standard. ISA would give better performance in some areas, while PCI
            yielded better performance in other areas.<br><bR>

            In physical appearance the ISA and PCI ports are vastly different. The ISA is longer (by about two inches),
            and thus the I/O cards that connect via ISA tend to be bulkier as well. Their differences do not stop there.
            PCI is a significantly faster (in theory) bus. PCI has double (or in rare instances, quadruple) the
            bit-width, resulting in faster data transfer.<br><bR>

            When placed head-to-head, PCI is definitely the better and faster option. Which is to be expected,
            considering PCI is a full ten years newer. While, in 2010, ISA is practically obsolete and PCI is well on
            its way to extinction as PCI-E and Mini-PCI-E gain steam, they are still in use by many consumers and
            industries. ISA and PCI made a significant impact on the computer industry.
        </p>
        <h3>External Network Cards</h3>
        <p>
            In desktops and laptops that do not have an internal NIC, external NICs are used. External network cards are
            of two types: Wireless and USB based. Wireless network card needs to be inserted into the motherboard,
            however no network cable is required to connect to the network. They are useful while traveling or accessing
            a wireless signal.
        </p>
        <h3>Hub</h3>
        <p>
            Hub is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices. When computer requests for
            information from a computer, it sends the request to the Hub. Hub distributes this request to all the
            interconnected computers<br><Br>
            A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network. They are
            generally used to connect computers in a LAN.<br><Br>

            A hub has many ports in it. A computer which intends to be connected to the network is plugged in to one of
            these ports. When a data frame arrives at a port, it is broadcast to every other port, without considering
            whether it is destined for a particular destination or not.<br><Br>
            They operate in the physical layer of the OSI model.<br>
            It is a non-intelligent network device that sends message to all ports.<br>
            It primarily broadcasts messages.<br>
            Transmission mode is half duplex.<br>
            Collisions may occurs during setup of transmission when more than one computers place data simultaneously in
            the corresponding ports.<br>
            They are passive devices, they don’t have any software associated with it.<br>
            They generally have fewer ports of 4/12.
        </p>
        <h3>switches</h3>
        <p>
            Switch is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another
            device. A switch is better than Hub as it does not broadcast the message over the network, i.e., it sends
            the message to the device for which it belongs to. Therefore, we can say that switch sends the message
            directly from source to the destination.<br><br>
